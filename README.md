# ObjCStore
Objective-C died really hard once apple released Swift in 2016. So I thought I would make a quick little AppStore so other people can learn how to create one in this languange! I have other similar projects like a store made in UIKit w/ swift and for a SwiftUI version you can check out Casp's GitHub.

# About Me
I am DebianArch and I love advanced UI design and developing apps. I am mainly a SwiftUI person because of how fast you can get things done compared to UIKit and what you can do completely programmatically. Make sure to check out my upcoming Scarlet Project which will be an absolute game changer to current 3rd party AppStores. It'll also feature new things like notifications, a dynamic DNS, auto color detection, and so much more.
